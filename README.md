### Hi, I'm Gabriela👋

Hi! My name is Gabriela Horcasitas and I'm a front-end developer with a degree in Psychology.

During my studies on psychology I discovered how our interactions can be transformed thanks to the use of technological interfaces.

Today I can be part of that transformation as a frond-end developer with notions of user experience thanks to my training as a psychologist focused on perception and its shaping as a result of the interaction we have with the environment.

- 🏫I'm currently preparing as a developer in Laboratoria bootcamp.
- 🏗 I've developed projects based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Node.JS.
- 🙌 Each project has been builded on prioritizing the user experience.
